# Ideas
- time limit for player moves
- retract cards of the border when other players peek
- during each player turn phase highlight the slots with wich can be interacted
- initially implement a simple heuristic algorithm for computer players with a success probability in function of difficulty (keep track of own viewed cards, draw from bin if opportune else draw from stack, swap if lower else discard, discard when identical, dutch below threshold score)
